Using Jenkins Code for Pipeline Automation

Introduction: This document outlines the process by which the automation team can utilize code written by the Jenkins team to automate a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. Jenkins, an open-source automation server, facilitates this by enabling reliable and efficient automation of build, test, and deployment processes.

Roles and Responsibilities

1.	Jenkins Team:
⦁	Develop and Maintain Jenkins Pipelines: Write and maintain Develop Jenkinsfiles and scripts that define the CI/CD pipeline stages.
2.	Automation Team:
⦁	Utilize Jenkins Pipelines: Use the provided Jenkins pipelines to automate build, test, and deployment processes.
⦁	Customize and Extend Pipelines: Adapt and extend the Jenkins pipelines as needed to fit specific project requirements.
⦁	Monitor and Maintain Automation: Ensure the automated processes run smoothly and address any issues that arise during execution.
⦁	Feedback and Improvement: Provide feedback to the Jenkins team for continuous improvement of the pipelines.

SCRIPT:for development
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/SucharithaSathupalli01/Project-Development.git'
            }
        }
    }
}

SCRIPT:for UAT phase
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/SucharithaSathupalli01/Project-UAT.git'
            }
        }
    }
}

SCRIPT:For production phase
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('clone') {
            steps {
                git 'https://github.com/SucharithaSathupalli01/Project-Production.git'
            }
        }
    }
}


Process Overview

 Pipeline Execution:
⦁	The automation team triggers the pipeline manually or sets up automatic triggers (e.g., on code commit) as per project requirements.
⦁	Jenkins executes the defined stages (build, test, deploy) sequentially or in parallel as defined in the Jenkins file.
⦁	 The automation team monitors the execution of the pipeline using Jenkins’ dashboard and logs.
⦁	The automation team provides feedback on the pipeline’s performance and any challenges faced.


The Jenkins team iteratively improves the pipeline based on this feedback, adding new features, optimizing performance, and fixing bugs.
